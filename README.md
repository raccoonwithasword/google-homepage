Google Homepage
This is basically a chance to deconstruct the Google homepage and rebuild it in my image. 
It might suck, though, so there's that.
I guess, wish me luck?
I'll come back at the end and tell you how I think I did.

â€¢ I have abandoned it for three days.

* That took a lot! I'm finally done, and I'm honestly not sure I learnt anything other than how to google stuff and how to reference my own code.
It was pretty amazing to do something on my own, though. It isn't perfect, but it's something.
Okay, that is all. The Odin Project shall continue.
Maybe I'll come back and build the search results page later.
